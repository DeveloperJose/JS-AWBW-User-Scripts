# Script List

## 1) AWBW Music Player (DeveloperJose Edition)
Filename: **awbw_music_player.js**

This is a modified version of twiggy_'s original AWBW Music Player 2.0.8 script (https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/459630-awbw-music-player) with the following changes:
* When a turn change happens, if the next CO is the same as the previous CO the music won't restart.
* If you change the turn with the turn selector checkbox (the one with the numbers) the music will change accordingly as well. Before it only changed the music if you used the turn selector arrows to go forward/backward.
